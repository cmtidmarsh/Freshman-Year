				Instructions:

To play, use your curser—or mouse—to click different points
on the screen to find where the cheese is.

To get started, Select a level at the top right of the game window.

In each level, you will have 10 tries to find 
both cheeses that are hidden somewhere in the kitchen.
Hints will appear at points throughout the game to help you!
If you don’t find both of the cheeses, then the cheeses will appear.
If you only find 1 of the 2 cheeses, then the other cheese will appear.
If you find both of the cheeses, you win!

Once both cheeses are found, a message (“Play again?”) will pop 
up in the Python shell! Type “Y” for yes or “N” for no.

If “Y” is typed, select a level and play again!
If “N” is typed, you will be taken to an ending window!


				Good Luck!
